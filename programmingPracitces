2. All settings (including database settings) must be put in the settings file. Nothing should be hardcoded.Like even coefficients for the algorithm.
3. Names of variables must reflect its purpose.
4. Commenting and indentation is compulsory.
5. All SQL statements as far as possible must be written in the class files.

Use filter_var($str, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
  $data = trim($data);
  $data = stripslashes($data);
  $data = htmlspecialchars($data);
  
  
7. All objects should be accessed using their id, not any other attribute like name (like for UPDATE statements)
8. Do not push broken versions.
9. But keep commiting on your computer as soon as you make even small progress. Comment every commit well.
10. Before starting - always check which branch you are on using 'git branch' and pull before you start working.
